# Filename Prefix Removal Tool

## Function
This is a simple batch file used to remove prefixes from file names.

This is specific to .WAV .AIF .MP3 and .ASD files, however this can easily be altered to include any file type.

## Purpose
I created this tool specifically for renaming track stems from Ableton Live.

In Ableton, when you export stems, you are forced to provide a track name prefix that will be appended to every file name.

As a result, you end up with "Prefix Bass.wav", "Prefix Lead.wav", etc. as opposed to "Bass.wav" & "Lead.wav"
